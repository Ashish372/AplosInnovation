# Proposal: Enhanced Supply Chain Ontology – Logistics Automation  

## Objective  
To strengthen the existing supply chain ontology by incorporating **supplier** and **transportation cost** data, enabling end-to-end logistics automation with improved efficiency, cost optimization, and risk management.  

## Key Data Additions  

### 1. Supplier Integration  
Introduce entities for **Supplier** and **Product-Supplier relationships** that capture:  
- Lead times & minimum order quantities  
- Unit costs & bulk discounts  
- Reliability & quality performance scores  
- Location & payment terms  

**Impact:**  
- Enables smarter supplier selection based on cost, lead time, and quality.  
- Supports automated purchase order generation aligned with demand forecasts.  
- Improves procurement risk management through performance tracking.  

### 2. Transportation Cost Matrix  
Incorporate structured data for transportation cost modeling, including:  
- Route-level costs (per unit, per kg, minimum charges)  
- Transit times & service levels by carrier  
- Origin → warehouse route mapping  

**Impact:**  
- Optimizes total landed cost by balancing supplier price with transportation expenses.  
- Improves carrier and route selection to meet service-level and cost objectives.  
- Reduces emergency shipping costs through proactive planning.  

## Expected Benefits  
- **Operational Efficiency:** Automation of procurement decisions and logistics workflows.  
- **Cost Optimization:** Smarter supplier and route selection lowers procurement and shipping costs.  
- **Strategic Agility:** Improved visibility into supplier reliability and transportation trade-offs.
