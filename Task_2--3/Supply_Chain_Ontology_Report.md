# Supply Chain Ontology & Automation Report

## Executive Summary

This report explains the ontology design approach, automation logic, and business value of the implemented supply chain management system based on the original ontology diagram (`oa.drawio`). The system transforms traditional reactive inventory management into an intelligent, data-driven automation platform.

## 1. Ontology Design Approach

### 1.1 Entity-Relationship Foundation

The ontology follows a **normalized relational database design** with seven core entities that represent the complete supply chain ecosystem:

#### **Core Business Entities**
- **Customer** - End consumers placing orders
- **Product** - Items being sold and managed
- **Order** - Customer purchase transactions
- **Warehouse** - Storage and distribution facilities

#### **Operational Entities**
- **Inventory** - Stock levels per product-warehouse combination
- **Shipment** - Delivery tracking and logistics
- **Carrier** - Shipping service providers

### 1.2 Design Principles Applied

#### **Referential Integrity**
```
Customer (1) ←→ (Many) Order ←→ (Many) Product
Warehouse (1) ←→ (Many) Inventory ←→ (Many) Product  
Order (1) ←→ (1) Shipment ←→ (Many) Carrier
Warehouse (1) ←→ (Many) Shipment
```

#### **Data Validation Constraints**
- **Pattern Enforcement**: Customer IDs (C001-C050), Product IDs (P001-P030), Order IDs (O0001-O0200)
- **Business Rules**: Order dates cannot be future, delivery dates ≥ ship dates
- **Data Integrity**: Non-negative quantities, positive prices, valid email formats

#### **Composite Key Design**
- **Inventory Table**: Uses composite primary key (`product_id + warehouse_id`)
- **Relationship Optimization**: Eliminates redundancy while maintaining query performance

### 1.3 Ontological Completeness

The design captures the **complete supply chain lifecycle**:
1. **Customer Registration** → **Order Placement** → **Inventory Allocation**
2. **Warehouse Assignment** → **Carrier Selection** → **Shipment Tracking**
3. **Delivery Completion** → **Inventory Updates** → **Performance Analytics**

## 2. Automation Logic

### 2.1 Intelligent Restocking Algorithm

#### **Multi-Factor Analysis Engine**
```python
# Core Algorithm Components
Sales Velocity = Total Units Sold (30 days) / 30 days
Reorder Point = Sales Velocity × (Avg Shipment Time + Safety Buffer)
Safety Stock = Sales Velocity × Safety Stock Period (14 days)
Target Stock = Safety Stock + (Sales Velocity × Replenishment Period)
Recommended Quantity = Target Stock - Available Stock
```

#### **Urgency Scoring System**
```python
Urgency Score = (Reorder Point - Available Stock) / Reorder Point × 100%

# Classification:
# 100% = Out of Stock (Critical)
# 75-99% = Very High Priority  
# 50-74% = High Priority
# 25-49% = Medium Priority
# 0-24% = Low Priority
```

### 2.2 Data Integration Logic

#### **Historical Trend Analysis**
- **30-Day Sales Velocity**: Calculates demand patterns from recent order history
- **Shipment Time Integration**: Factors actual delivery performance per warehouse
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Accounts for demand fluctuations over time

#### **Multi-Warehouse Optimization**
```sql
-- Sales velocity calculation per warehouse
SELECT 
    o.product_id,
    s.warehouse_id,
    SUM(o.quantity) / 30.0 as daily_velocity
FROM orders o
JOIN shipment s ON o.order_id = s.order_id
WHERE o.order_date >= (CURRENT_DATE - 30 days)
GROUP BY o.product_id, s.warehouse_id
```

### 2.3 Supply Chain Analytics Automation

#### **Carrier Performance Analysis**
- **Delivery Time Metrics**: Average, minimum, maximum delivery days
- **On-Time Performance**: Percentage of deliveries meeting estimated dates
- **Service Level Analysis**: Performance by Express, Standard, Economy tiers

#### **Product Performance Intelligence**
- **Revenue Ranking**: Top 5 products by sales volume and revenue
- **Customer Reach**: Unique customer count per product
- **Category Analysis**: Performance distribution across product categories

#### **Inventory Shortage Detection**
- **Real-Time Status**: OUT_OF_STOCK, CRITICAL (<7 days), LOW (<14 days), ADEQUATE
- **Demand-Supply Gap**: Current stock vs. predicted consumption
- **Warehouse Prioritization**: Critical shortage identification by location
